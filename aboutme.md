My name is Carolina Benzaquen. I have the following qualities:

- I love trading the financial markets, specially Futures assets
- I enjoy more designing trading strategies and automating my trades than executing the orders myself. 

### My story

I am a multi Asset trader, mainly focused on day and swing trades....However, I wasn't a trader before. About 4 years ago, I decided to educate myself in the financial markets to manage my own retirement porfolio. Almost instantly I felt in love with the financial markets. I got completely fascinated with market movements...with upswings, downswings, etc...so I decided to switch careers altogether and became a Full time trader.

First I educated myself..I took trading lessons and learned the basics of trading, and overall learned a basic trading strategy that got my foot in the water.

However, for some reason, I executed something completely different that what I intended to...so I dabbed into coding.

At first, my coding was focused on indicators, studies, strategies...etc. But after a while, I realized that the key to be succesful in my trading career I was to automate my entries and exits...and to accomplish so, I enrolled in coding lessons geared toward the brockerage platform I use.

Then as I became more proficient in my coding, I found out about open-sourced `Python` and its infinitive libraries so I enrolled in Rice University coding Bootcamp.

Now, I proudly finished my coding bootcamp and I am in full fledge of developing my trading prototype which I intent to release soon.
